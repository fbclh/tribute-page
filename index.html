      <h4>About Minimalism:</h4>
      <p>In visual arts, music, and other mediums, minimalism is an art movement that began in postâ€“World War II Western art,
        most strongly with American visual arts in the 1960s and early 1970s. Prominent artists associated with minimalism include Donald Judd,
        John McCracken, Agnes Martin, Dan Flavin, Robert Morris, Anne Truitt, and Frank Stella.
        It derives from the reductive aspects of modernism and is often interpreted as a reaction against
        abstract expressionism and a bridge to postminimal art practices.</p>
    
      <p>Minimalism in music often features repetition and iteration such as those of the compositions of La Monte Young,
        Terry Riley, Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Julius Eastman, and John Adams.
        The term minimalist often colloquially refers to anything that is spare or stripped to its essentials.
        It has accordingly been used to describe the plays and novels of Samuel Beckett, the films of Robert Bresson,
        the stories of Raymond Carver, and the automobile designs of Colin Chapman.</p>

      <p>The term minimalism is also used to describe a trend in design and architecture, wherein the subject is reduced to its necessary elements.
        Minimalist architectural designers focus on the connection between two perfect planes, elegant lighting,
        and the void spaces left by the removal of three-dimensional shapes in an architectural design.
        Minimalistic design has been highly influenced by Japanese traditional design and architecture.</p>
